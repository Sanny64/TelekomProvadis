# TelekomProvadis
Basic Website for University

TelekomProvadis is my first ever project and includes a simple website with a Guess-The-Number-Minigame and a few optical optimizations. 


## Website

The website is **offline** at the moment and can't be accessed by anyone but those that have the developers link. It may get released at a later point.

### The minigame

The minigame is a simple **guess the number** from 1 - 10. If you enter a number lower than the previously randomly generated number, it will tell you that the number we are looking for is higher and the other way around.

### UI
For the minigame we have made a UI that contains all text and also the origin creators of the website.

### Add-Ons
Also on the website we have two pictures that link to the websites of Telekom and Provadis. They have a little background that turns white if users hover over it with their mouse cursor.

## The Code
I am completly new to coding, therefore this website was *mainly made by ChatGPT* and with the help of two dear co-workers.
I originally started on replit.com and then changed to VSCode. 

### Storing
The code is mainly stored on my GitHub account.
